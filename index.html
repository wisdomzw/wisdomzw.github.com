                        <p>Participating in iXperience was one of the best decisions I've made! Even though it was remote, I was still able to build friendships while learning essential skills to excel in my future career.</p>

                        <p>iXperience gave me not only a vast amount of knowledge but also the tools to conduct myself professionally. I learned concepts, but more importantly I learned how to communicate and work with other people in a new environment.</p>

                        <p>By constantly making connections between UX, Engineering, and customer value, the teaching team introduced me a new skill set that I would never have thought to look into. The interactive lessons truly affirmed my interest in the field, and gave me more confidence in managing a product to success.</p>

                        <p>My Remote experience was truly eye-opening. It completely surpassed my expectations of the remote environment by introducing me to peers and teachers who I developed real bonds with and learned a lot from. I applaud the team for pushing the limits of what can be accomplished.</p>
